\item\problemnumber{6}{Supplemental}{48}{-}{-}
The unsigned Stirling number of the first kind ${n \brack k}$ where $k$ and $n$
are integers with $1 \le k \le n$, equals the number of ways to arrange $n$
people around $k$ circular tables with at least one person seated at each
table, where two seatings of $m$ people around a circular table are considered
the same if everyone has the same left neighbor and the same right neighbor.
