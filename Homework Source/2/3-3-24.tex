An algorithm is called \emph{optimal} for the solution of a problem with respect
to a specified operation if there is no algorithm for solving this problem using
fewer operations.
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii}.}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
\item Show that Algorithm~1 in Section~3.1 is an optimal algorithm with respect
    to the number of comparisons of integers. [Note: Comparisons used for
    bookkeeping in the loop are not of concern here.]
\item Is the linear search algorithm optimal with respect to the number of
    comparisons of integers (not including comparisons used for bookkeeping in
    the loop)?
